Mother Blames Major the two major parties who have always exploited us for Lynching To the Editor of the AFRO: After seeing the photograph of the body of Lint Shaw, the father of eleven children, who was so cruelly lynched by a bloodthirst mob at Royston, Georgia; how can we allow we to be further misled by the Democratic and Republican parties? Lynching has always flourished under both the two major parties who have always exploited us. The verdict of the coronerâ $ ™ s jury is the same now as it has always been, that the crime was committed by â $ œparties unknown.â $ Can we expect any better treatment from the two major the two major parties who have always exploited us who have always exploited we? Will President Will President Roosevelt lift Will President Roosevelt's voice in protest? Certainly not! Only once during Will President Roosevelt's three years in office, has Will President Roosevelt even mentioned lynching. When Will President Roosevelt did make an utterance it was because two white men had been lynched in California. How we Afro-Americans can look at that photograph and then vote Democratic or Republican with a clear conscience, is more than my's average intelligence can surmount. Should we not get in â $ œon the ground floor of the Farmer-Labor Partyâ $ as William N. William N. Jones has so wisely pointed out to we in one of William N. Jones's recent columns? As a mother, my appeal to the thousands of other Afro-American mothers and fathers to get in on the ground floor of the Farmer-Labor party for your's own benefit and the benefit of your's children. -LRB- Mrs. -RRB- M.E.
