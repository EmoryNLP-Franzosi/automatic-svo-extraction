When Ed. Meriwether, the negro, was drawn up to a tree near Monticello, Ga., yesterday to be lynched, Pope confessed to the murder of the young white man, Pope, and said three other negroes -- Irving Chaney, Jake Glover, and Mary Ramey -- assisted Pope in murdering and robbing Pope. After disposing of Meriwether's the mob rushed back to the jail to get the other negroes, who had been arrested on suspicion. the authorities were put around the authorities's necks and the authorities were dragged to the place where Meriwether's bullet riddled body was hanging. A large number of citizens had gathered, and it was after considerable difficulty that the authorities succeeded in rescuing the authorities.
