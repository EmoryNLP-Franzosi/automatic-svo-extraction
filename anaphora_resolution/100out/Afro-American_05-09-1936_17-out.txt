THIS TIME THE MOB WAS SUCCESSFULÃ¢ $'' Body of Lint Shaw, 45-year-old Georgia farmer, who was savagely murdered last week by a white mob at Royston. Shaw, who weighed 225 pounds and was the father of eleven children, swore the victim was at home with the victim's family when the crime of which the victim was accused was committed. The body was found tied to a pine tree and was riddled with shot-gun, pistol and rifle bullets, marks of which can be seen in the victim's chest. Plow lines and cotton ropes were used to hang the victim. Only a few weeks ago, the victim was saved from mobbers in this same section.
