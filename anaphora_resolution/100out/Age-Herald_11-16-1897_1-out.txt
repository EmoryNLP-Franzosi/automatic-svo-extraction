Negro Desperado Killed Macon, Ga., Nov. 15. â $'' A special to the Telegraph from Gibson, Ga., says: Last night about 12 oâ $ ™ clock a fusillade of shots startled the neighborhood about six miles below here and this morning the dead body of Josh Ruff was found in the road. Josh Ruff was a negro desperado and being well armed held up negroes and took money and provisions at will. It is thought Josh Ruff's victims ran Josh Ruff down and shot Josh Ruff. Josh Ruff must have fought for Josh Ruff's life, as trails of blood were discerned for two miles along the public road.
