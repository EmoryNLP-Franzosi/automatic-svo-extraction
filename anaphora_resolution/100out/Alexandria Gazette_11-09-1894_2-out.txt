A Sensational Lynching;. Macon, Ga., Nov. 9. Some days ago Lee Lawrence, a negro, a negro, criminally assaulted a white woman at Monticello and made the judge's escape, but was captured near Jonesboro. Yesterday the jury found Lee Lawrence, a negro guilty and be was sentenced to hang on November 30. Almost before the judge had got the sentencing words out of the judge's mouth, bystanders grabbed the negro and hustled the judge outside, turning the judge over to a mob of five hundred people who hanged the judge to the limb of a tree nearby.
