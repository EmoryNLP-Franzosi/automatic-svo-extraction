Way Clear for Lynch Bill, Senator Barkley, this week Reminded NEW YORK. â $'' Insisting that the Senate Majority Leader call for the anti lynching bill at once, â $ œnow that most of the legislation for national defense has been disposed of, â $ Walter White, secretary of the NAACP, told Senator Barkley, this week, this week, that we can not make democracy a reality in America â $ œas long as the mob rides.â $ Whiteâ $ ™ s statement was contained in a letter sent to Barkley September 9, the day following the death of 16-year-old Austin Callaway in LaGrange, Ga., the sixth lynching victim this year. Nazis Not Sole Threat â $ œWe agree, â $ the NAACP secretary said, â $ œthat it is important to protect America from the spirit of racial bigotry and mob violence which are a part of the basis of the methods used by totalitarian powers and particularly that of Nazi Germany. â $ œBut while we are building ships, planes, and guns to keep Hitler out, it is imperative that at the same time we make democracy a reality in the United States, and that can not be done as long as the mob still rides.â $ Tenn.. Vote Terror Cited The letter pointed to the terror aroused against colored citizens in Brownsville, Tenn., resulting in the lynching of Elber Williams, and the tragic status of the Rev. Buster Walker and Elisha Davis, both of whom were forced to flee their's homes, because their sought the right to vote. All the Administration force should be rallied behind the bill White concluded, in an effort to insure passage by the Senate before Congress adjourns.
