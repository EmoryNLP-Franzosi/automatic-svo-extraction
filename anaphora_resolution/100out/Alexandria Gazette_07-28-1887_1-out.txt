NEGRO RAVISHES LYNCHEDâ $'' a mob Redon, GA., yesterday lynched Reuben Johnson Hudson, colored. Outrage the person of Mrs. James Bush, Tuesday. 11 oâ $ ™ clock Mrs. Bush was entirely alone, her husband having gone to church and her little daughter was away from home. She was preparing for dinner when the Negroes suddenly sprang into the room, and, despite her screams and struggles, brutally outraged her. His's great black and was held over her mouth and she was alternatively smothered and choked. In the meantime His threatened to kill her, and when Mrs. Bush, trying to frighten the brute, said her husband would answer her screams, the Negro said: â $ œyour husband canâ $ ™ t hear you, I saw His when His went up to the railroad carrying an umbrella.â $ This showed that His had watched His's time. When Hudson was arrested the woman identified His, and His was immediately hanged to a convenient tree. His had been guilty of other depredations. Ten days or two weeks ago a brutal assault was committed in the Surry County, Va., by a Negro named Reuben Cole upon Mrs. Richard Savage. Reuben Cole was subsequently arrested and jailed. Excitement over the affair and indignation against the have been at fervor heat ever since, and lynching was freely talked us. Last Monday being County Court day there was an unusual gathering of people, and lynching talk was so great that the sheriff had an extra guard placed around the jail. Tuesday night, however, a band of fifty men went to the jail, overpowered the card and jailer, and took Reuben Cole out and hanged His to a tree, but they left the body and then quietly departed.
