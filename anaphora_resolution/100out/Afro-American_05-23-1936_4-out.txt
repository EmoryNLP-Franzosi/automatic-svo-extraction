Again, Leave Dixie! To the Editor of the AFRO: The picture in the AFRO for May 9, showing the horrible lynching of Lint Shaw of Georgia has set me to thinking more seriously of how long people must be tortured thus. me gree with you in saying, â $ œGet Out of the South.â $ Why stay and be lynched? me am not in the deep South, but far enough down to be uncomfortable. -LRB- Miss -RRB- FREDERICKA A.
