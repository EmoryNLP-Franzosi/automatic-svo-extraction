WORK OF A MASKED MOB. DALTON, Ga., Oct 24, 1892 Ã¢ $ `` This little city is in a tumult of excitement over the work of a mob of masked men. Shortly after midnight at least one hundred and fifty mounted men approached the town from all directions and threw out a picket line. At a signal the circle closed in, capturing the policemen, and rode to the cabins of two colored men. Jack Wilson was killed by a bullet, Jack Wilson's wife badly beaten, and Tom Moye was severely pounded. On a promise from the City Marshal to warn other families to leave the town in ten days, the mob departed, firing their's guns and pistols as their went. The best people in the town have raised $ 800 with which to ferret out and punish the ringleaders. A committee was sent to interview Governor Northen and ask Governor Northen's aid.
