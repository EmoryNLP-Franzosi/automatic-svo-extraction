BODY TORN BY SHOT. Corpse of Shanon Adams Ponnd in the Chattahoochee River. COLUMBUS, Ga., June 21 â $ `` The body of a negro man, supposed to be that of Shmon Adams, lynched north of the city a few days ago, was found in the river just below the North Highlands dam this morning by Mr. Charles Allen. There was not a stitch of clothing on the body, the head was gone, the tongue adhering to the esophagus, the right arm practically fleshless and bone broken, the skin slipping. The body was practically shot to pieces. A piece of paper six inches square could not have been laid on his's body anywhere without covering a shot wound. There were bullet holes in his's arms, legs, back, abdomen, chest, hands and feet. It was the opinion of bystanders that his's head had been riddled also. The juryâ $ ™ s verdict was that the deceased was an unknown negro man who came to his's death by unknown captives. Simon Adams was lynched for entering the bed room of the daughters of Judge E R Almond a few days ago.
