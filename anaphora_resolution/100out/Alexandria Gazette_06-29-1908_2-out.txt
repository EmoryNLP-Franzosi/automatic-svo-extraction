Walter Wilkins and Albert Baker, The negroes, were lynched by a mob of 1,000 persons late Saturday on the eastern outskirts of Waycross, Ga.. The negroes were brought there form Wayne county, one of The negroes charged with assaulting the 14-year-old daughter of Wiley Wainwright Thursday evening. The negroes were being taken by Wayne county officers from the jail there to Jessup for safekeeping, when the mob rushed the officer and hung the two prisoners. In the rush a dozen hands clasped each the officer and the officer's gun. The negroes were jerked across the railroad track and a hundred persons pounced upon The negroes, others still holding the guards. The little girl has since died.
