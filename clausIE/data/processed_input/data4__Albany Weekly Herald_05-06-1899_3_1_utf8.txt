WAS KILLED BY NEGROES.Further Details of the Lee County WAS NOT ENOCH DANIEL.Alfred Thurman Was Decoyed From His Home at Night and Shot to Death by Men Presumably of His Own Race—Details of the Affair Learned by Jury From Saturday’s Herald: From a prominent citizen of Leesburg who was in the city today the HERALD learned further particulars of the lynching of Wednesday night, an account of which appeared in these columns yesterday. The mob’s victim was not Enoch Daniel, as reported by our informant at Leesburg yesterday, but Alfred Thurman, a well-known negro farmer Thurman was also quite an expert detective and was frequently employed by the Lee county officials in hunting down criminals. For this he was cordially hated by the negroes for miles around. Wednesday night about 1 o’clock he was called from his home and decoyed down the road about a mile, where he was shot to death by a party of negroes. Their tracks indicated that their number was probably about a dozen. These facts were brought out at a coroner’s inquest held yesterday afternoon. No arrests have been made, although the officers are at work on the case.
