One Will Hang.And Four Others Go Up For Life.Verdicts in the last trials of the famous Miller County murder cases--- Dews Bailey convicted without recommendation, while Florence Bailey and Isaac Garder will serve life sentences--- Five in all convicted. Colquitt, Ga., Feb. 6. (Special.) ---Two juries in the famous Miller county murder cases, after having been out for more than 24 hours, have returned verdicts of guilty, thus convicting the last five men who were placed on trial during the special term of Miller superior court called to determine the guilt or innocence of the seven parties charged with the murder of old man J. P. Rustin and his son, Virgil Rustin. It will be remembered that Burrell Philips was convicted on Wednesday and his son, George, or Coot Philips, on the day following, both being found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for life. Dews and Florence Bailey were jointly tried on Saturday morning and Isaac Gardner that afternoon. All through Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night the two juries remained out, unable to agree. Early this morning, however, they returned a verdict. The jury before whom the Bailey brothers were tried declared both to be guilty, but recommended Florence to the mercy of the court. Isaac Gardner was found guilty by the other jury but recommended him mercy. He, together with Florence Bailey, will today be sentenced to life imprisonment by Judge Sheffield and Dews Bailey will have the sentence of death passed upon him.
