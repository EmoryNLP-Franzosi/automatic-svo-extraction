NEGRO LYNCHED NEAR SHELLMAN.SHERMAN HARRIS HAD MURDERED MR. SID KING.The Murderer Had Been Given A Preliminary Trial and Bail Was Refused – Officers on Their Way to Cuthbert Jail Overtaken by a Mob – Great Excitement Prevails. Shellman, Ga., March 13. – Sherman Harris, the negro who killed Mr. Sid King at Knighton, a country postoffice ten miles below this place, on Monday afternoon, was lynched last night. The particulars, as your correspondent can learn them, are that Mr. King had a quarrel with the negro about a week prior to the killing. Since that time Harris has been going armed, and making threats as to what he intended to do to King. On learning of these threats, Mr. King went to the plantation of Mr. T. Barfield where Harris was employed, to see him. When asked about the reports Harris replied that, “yes he had made them and would do what he said,” whereupon he ran into his house nearby, got his shot gun, returned and when near Mr. King fired, the entire load entering King’s leg just above the knee, producing death in about 15 minutes, from loss of blood. Harris was arrested and given trial before a magistrate Tuesday afternoon and bond denied. Last night, as the officers were en route to Cuthbert with him, they were overtaken by a mob of masked citizens, who took their prisoner from them; a rope was placed around his neck and he was suspended from the limb of a tree nearby, after which he was completely riddled with bullets. Great excitement prevails and further trouble is feared. Mr. King was a prosperous farmer and merchant and stood high in his section. He leaves a wife and several small children. The body of Harris at this hour is still hanging to the limb.
