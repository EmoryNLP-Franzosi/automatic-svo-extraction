# Line 4 (id 3): The conservative press of the country is expected to deprecate, and even denounce in the strongest terms, these outbreaks of lawlessness, but so long as such outrageous crimes as the one of which Mr. And Mrs. Maroney, of Lee county, were the victims are committed in civilized communities, and the officers of the law and the judges of our's courts are dilatory about apprehending the criminals and bringing them to speedy trial, it must be expected that in such aggravated cases as the one in Lee county the people will now and then rise in the people's wrath and take the execution of the law into the people's own hands.

# Line 37 (id 36): The conservative press of the country is expected to deprecate, and even denounce in the strongest terms, these outbreaks of lawlessness, but so long as such outrageous crimes as the one of which Mr. And Mrs. Maroney, of Lee county, were the victims are committed in civilized communities, and the officers of the law and the judges of our courts are dilatory about apprehending the criminals and bringing them to speedy trial, it must be expected that in such aggravated cases as the one in Lee county the people will now and then rise in their wrath and take the execution of the law into their own hands.
