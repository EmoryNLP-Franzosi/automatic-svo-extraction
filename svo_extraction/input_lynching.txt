0	Bill Cato, a Negro Saw Mill Hand, Attempted to Assault Mrs. Vickers -- He Was Taken From the Doerun Guard House and Shot to Death -- Made Confession of Crime.
1	News of a lynching which occurred at Doerun, Worth county, twenty-one miles from Albany to an early hour yesterday morning, reached the city today.
2	It seems that an effort was made to keep the story of the lynching as quiet as possible, and the HERALD only learned of the affair this morning by chance.
3	It appears that on last Monday night a negro saw mill hand named Bill Cato entered the home of a Mr. Vickers and attempted a criminal assault on Mrs. Vickers.
4	a Mr. Vickers designs were frustrated by a Mr. Vickers intended victim 's screams and the interference of a Mr. Vickers husband.
5	Cato made Bill Cato escape.
6	Next day Bill Cato was captured, however, by some of the saw mill men of the neighborhood, who, strange to relate, let Bill Cato off with a severe whipping and ordered Bill Cato to leave the state.
7	The negro departed, but unwisely remained in the neighborhood.
8	When the people of Doerun heard of the crime they decided that Cato had not been sufficiently punished.
9	They organized a search for Bill Cato and finally succeeded in capturing Bill Cato.
10	Bill Cato was placed in the Doerun guard house, and was not only identified by Mrs. Vickers as the right party, but, it is stated made a voluntary confession.
11	At an early hour yesterday morning a mob of quiet but thoroughly determined men went to the guard house, forced the locks on the doors and took charge of Cato.
12	Bill Cato was carried outside and about seventy-five shots were fired into this body.
13	Bill Cato corpse was found after daylight within a few feet of the guard house door.
