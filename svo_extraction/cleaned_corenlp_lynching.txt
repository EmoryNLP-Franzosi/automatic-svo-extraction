The mob is said to be still on the hunt for negroes, and it is probable that two more will be lynched. PALMETTO, Ga., April 25.  The body of Lige Strickland, a negro preacher, the negro implicated by Sam Hose, just as the torch was about to be applied to the pile of wood under him in the killing of Alfred one good Winchester, was found swinging to the limb of a tree about one mile from town. The ears and fingers were cut off and the body was pinned a placard bearing these words:  We must protect our Southern women. Lige Strickland, a negro preacher was a negro minister, 60 years of age. Sam Hose, just as the torch was about to be applied to the pile of wood under him, just as the torch was about to be applied to the pile of wood under Lige Strickland, a negro preacher, admitted killing Alfred one good Winchester, but said that Lige Strickland, a negro preacher had given Lige Strickland, a negro preacher $ 12 to do the deed. The question of protection for the white the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts in the sparsely settled farming districts is the topic of the day. The Atlanta Constitution devotes a page to a collection of opinions on how proper protection can be afforded to the women of the country. Of the matter Governor Chandler has this to say:  The question for protection for women and homes in the country is one of deep interest and which weights upon my's heart. my think the wisest plan for protection will be fore the legislature to take up the matter and provide a sufficient state militia and funds to be expended for a patrol in the country districts. Oates Would Arm the Women Former Governor William J. Oates expressed one good Winchester as follows:  My first suggestion is that all homes should be made miniature arsenals, at least to the extent of one good one good Winchester and one good pistol; that the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts be allowed to carry weapons upon the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts's persons, concealed if so desired, and that the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts be taught the use and handling of firearms so the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts may become the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts's own protectors in the absence of the husband of master of the house. An occasional negro lying dead in the backyard, shot by a brave woman in defense of her honor, will do more to stop this awful crime than all the lynching that may occur in a year. my would have every county, supplied with at least half dozen well trained bloodhounds. Before the torch was touched to the pyre the every negro was deprived of every negro's ears, fingers and other portions of every negro's anatomy. The every negro pleaded pitifully for every negro's life while the mutilation was going on, but stood the ordeal of fire with surprising fortitude. Before the body was cool it was cut to pieces, the bones were crushed into small bits and even the tree upon which the wretch met the wretch's fate was torn up and disposed of as souvenirs. The mob was composed of citizens of Newnan, Griffin, Palmetto and other little towns in the country round about Newnan and of all the farmers who had received word that the burning was to take place. Before being put to death the every negro stated that every negro had been paid $ 12 by Lige Strickland, a negro preacher, a negro preacher at Palmetto, to kill Cranford. ATLANTA, Ga., May 7.

Thirty Blacks Killed Thirty Negroes Killed Thirty Negroes have been killed in the city within the past few hours and scores have been badly beaten and injured. The city went wild over assaults on twelve white women by Negroes and a mob early Sunday morning took possession of the streets and for several hours shot and beat all Blacks that could be found. The authorities were powerless to restore order, even with the aid of the fire department, and an appeal was made to the governor for troops. The trouble started late Saturday night when a Negro brutally assaulted a Mrs. Arnold. After being roughly handled, the woman managed to escape and ran screaming into a neighbor' s house. Mob Fills Streets News of the assault spread rapidly and crowds of men began gathering on the street corners and saloons where threats of wholesale lynchings were made. About this time, news of another assault was circulated and fifteen minutes later, a mob of frenzied men filled the streets and started to round up every black in the vicinity. Victim after victim after victim was shot and killed and many were wounded and beaten before Victim after victim could escape. the troops Ordered Out Prompt response was made to the call for troops and the militia was ordered to the scene. Today, the troops control the situation in the city and quiet has been restored. In the suburbs, however, the disturbances still continue and it is likely that detachments of militia will be sent there to preserve order. Feeling against the Thirty Blacks Killed Thirty Negroes is intense and if the troops were not here, it is probable the enraged citizens would begin a war of extermination. Every saloon in the city has been closed and will remain closed until all danger of writing is over. The record includes only cases of unmistakable lynching, leaving out those in which the victims were killed by pursuing posses while resisting capture. The record for last year was seventy-two. Crimes charged against those lynched range from robbery to assault and murder. It is worthy of notice that none of the victims was lynched for such petty or trivial crimes as in some previous years. A large majority of the victims were guilty of criminal assault or attempted criminal assault. Louisiana in Lead The lynchings were most numerous in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana. Farther north there were two lynchings in Maryland and one each in Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska. Altogether there were lychings in twelve states.

A mob estimated at 500 compose the shooting and burning party. Atrocious Crimes That Should be Investigated by the Government. The accounts of the so-called  race riot at Jessup, Ga., do not read very differently from other affairs of the kind that have happened in the South in recent years. All the leading features are the same. The creation of  trouble by some unfortunate black, who was probably the last citizen in town to wish to give trouble; the gathering and arming of the vengeance-seeking whites on the following day to resist an  attack that is not even contemplated; then the movement and assault upon the negroes, who are chased with bullets and blows to the swamps, there to be shot down as fast as they can be found, or if they attempt to emerge from they's hiding-places; a few straggling shots from the hunted quarry, which haply strike down a couple of the pursuers; then wholesale vengeance, slaughter and  punishment -- these are the points of the  race riot that continues to remain an institution existing only in the Southern States. The question naturally arises: If the dispatches sent to Northern newspapers, one-sided as they are, convey the slightest idea of the atrocities visited on the negroes, what sort of sentiment would those atrocities arouse if they were described in all they's actual enormity? According to the latest telegrams from Jessup, three white three white men have fallen in the present disturbance, while nearly a score of blacks have been killed or wounded. This is rather in excess of the usual average. As a general thing the casualties in a  race riot are at the rate of about 40 to 1, with the odds, of course, in favor of the vengeance-seeking whites on the following day. From whatever cause the fighting on Christmas Day may have originated, the acts of the vengeance-seeking the vengeance-seeking whites on the following day on the following day were cruel, devilish and detestable beyond power of description. The most atrocious act of all was the deliberate murder of two defenseless negroes who had been captured and locked up in jail. At two o'clock in the morning a mob of whites surrounded the building, battered down the doors and entered the cell where the wounded captives lay. It was in pitchy darkness. One of the new comers lit a match, and by its flickering light one of the prisoners, Peter Jackson was shot to death. This performance was repeated in the case of Bill Hopps, the other prisoner, and, leaving the corpses where they lay, the murderers left. A coroner's jury subsequently decided that the killing was the work of parties unknown! For the next twelve hours the vengeance-seeking whites on the following day engaged in a flogging crusade. All the buggy whips in the town wore bought up, and detachments of torturers half-a-dozen strong visited houses inhabited by negroes and mercilessly whipped the inmates. The large majority of those thus punished thus punished were females, and the condition of many of those thus punished, when those thus punished's tormentors had finished with those thus punished, is described as pitiable in the extreme. Bullets for the three white men, whips for the women, seemed to be the motto of the avengers, and the avengers lived up to it. It is no wonder that the negroes of the South leap with delight at emigration schemes. One  race riot such as this is sufficient to inoculate a desire in the most lethargic of  niggers to change his's quarters. Not until his does so is his safe, apparently. his's white masters are determined to rule his with terrorism and blood. his must submit to seeing his's his friends ill-treated, for if his lifts a hand in his friends's defense his will precipitate a  race riot and then, woe be unto his and his's fellows! The Southern  race riot is ono of the horrors of the age. This last one should be investigated by the Government. Macon, Ga., June 10.  W. Cope Winslow, Jr., whose father was one of the leading members of the Georgia bar, was instantly killed by a negro named  Banjo Peavy on the former' s farm, near Fort Valley named  Banjo Peavy on the former' s farm, near Fort Valley.

A. Young issued a statement that Bryan was perfectly innocent of any participation in the shooting affray in which Robert Freeman, white, Glynn County chief of police, met George Grant's death but no effort will be made to reprimand or bring the guilty officers to trial. Chief George Grant was shot when two men return desire after George Grant attempted to arrest two men because two men were seen near a bank.

Mother Blames Major the two major parties who have always exploited us for Lynching To the Editor of the AFRO: After seeing the photograph of the body of Lint Shaw, the father of eleven children, who was so cruelly lynched by a bloodthirst mob at Royston, Georgia; how can we allow we to be further misled by the Democratic and Republican parties? Lynching has always flourished under both the two major parties who have always exploited us. The verdict of the coroner' s jury is the same now as it has always been, that the crime was committed by  parties unknown. Can we expect any better treatment from the two major the two major parties who have always exploited us who have always exploited we? Will President Will President Roosevelt lift Will President Roosevelt's voice in protest? Only once during Will President Roosevelt's three years in office, has Will President Roosevelt even mentioned lynching. When Will President Roosevelt did make an utterance it was because two white men had been lynched in California. How we Afro-Americans can look at that photograph and then vote Democratic or Republican with a clear conscience, is more than my's average intelligence can surmount. As a mother, my appeal to the thousands of other Afro-American mothers and fathers to get in on the ground floor of the Farmer-Labor party for your's own benefit and the benefit of your's children. To the Editor of the AFRO: The picture in the AFRO for May 9, showing the horrible lynching of Lint Shaw of Georgia has set me to thinking more seriously of how long people must be tortured thus. me gree with you in saying,  Get Out of the South.

Well-to-Do Fisherman Slain Near Own Pond BAINBRIDGE, Ga.  The body of a 53-year-old Hollis Riles, well-to-do 200-acre farm owner, lay in the morgue of a local undertaker Sunday, as sheriff' s investigators and FBI agents launched a probe into his's slaying that had all the earmarks of a lynching. Riles was shot by five white five white men whom he had ordered off his fish pond, according to reports to Decatur County Sheriff A.E. White whom his had ordered off his's fish pond, according to reports to Decatur County Sheriff A.E. his's body was found Friday night propped up against a tree where his had staggered after being hit with 13 buckshot. The murder took place in the extreme northeast of Decatur County, about 14 miles from Bainbridge. Sheriff White expressed belief it was a case of premeditated murder, since Sheriff White was still investigating an incident of last May. At that time, Sheriff White $  s house was riddled with bullets fired from an unidentified automobile after Sheriff White had attempted to keep several white men from fishing in Sheriff White's pond. A coroner' s jury, which conducted an inquest by flashlight Friday night, found that Riles came to Riles's death from wounds  inflicted by unknown parties. Jess Gordon, 52, who accompanied Riles to Riles's pond, which is known as a fishing paradise, was a witness to the shooting. Felt Life in Danger Riles told Sheriff White that Riles and the farm owner went to the pond Friday afternoon. Riles carried Gordon's shotgun, having feared for some months Gordon's life was in danger. They found two white men lounging under a tree, They's guns beside They. At the pond They found two other white two other white men, one of whom had a string of fish, one of whom had a string of fish. Riles told the white two other white men, one of whom had a string of fish the pond was posted and They must either get off or pay for the privilege of fishing. One of the five white men whom he had ordered off his fish pond, according to reports to Decatur County Sheriff A.E. White gave the fish to Gordon after commenting that They did not know the pond was posted and promised to leave at once. Shortly afterwards, Gordon said Gordon heard shots and stood up to see four or five men shooting at Riles as Gordon ran across a clearing. The Gordon did not return Gordon's fire, Gordon said. Two more shots were heard about five minutes after the first shots, Gordon said. License Plates Covered The witness said Gordon watched two cars drive away. The license plate of one of the vehicles was covered, according to Gordon. Gordon said Gordon did not know the five white men whom he had ordered off his fish pond, according to reports to Decatur County Sheriff A.E. White and felt sure five white men whom he had ordered off his fish pond, according to reports to Decatur County Sheriff A.E. White were not from that section of Decatur County. After running a half mile to Rile' s house, Gordon returned later to the scene with Sheriff White and Mrs. Riles and Mrs. Riles. Sheriff White and Mrs. Riles found the Gordon in a sitting position against a tree. Estimates were Gordon had been dead more than an hour. Sheriff White found three shotgun shells, wadding, and a tree that had been pierced by a rifle bullet. Sheriff White $  s gun was not found. A county roads scraper had erased all tire tracks leading to the murder scene between the time the killers drove away and Sheriff White reached the scene. The Sheriff White asked FBI agents to aid in the murder probe. Vets' Attack Wins Friends for Paul Robeson, Hits Right to Speak The war veterans' demonstration against Paul Robeson has won Vetsâ millions of friends. The guarantee of free speech and free assembly is contained in the first Amendment to our Constitution. If the Klan can stage public meetings, why not other so-called  subversive organizations? We have no truck with Communism, but We know that the severest critics of segregation and mob violence are the followers of Paul Robeson and Henry Wallace. The murderous lynching of wealthy Hollis Riles in Bainbridge, Ga., because wealthy Hollis drove white poachers from wealthy Hollis's private fishing pond illustrates what We mean. It is a kind of terrorism that is prevalent in the South. Both neither Democrats nor Republicans will pass a Federal anti-lynching bill to punish the killers. The severest condemnation and the pledge to do something about it comes from the Progressives. McCamy was shot down by the mob, which surrounded the jail, he attempted to escape after the leaders took him from his cell.

Editor Lashes State also on Thursday, Ralph McGill, militant noted editor of the Atlanta Constitution of the Atlanta Constitution, devoted editor of the Atlanta Constitution's entire editorial column to a blistering indictment of the state' s  do-nothing role in the case up to that day. editor of the Atlanta Constitution declared in part:  there murder was more or less suppressed for four days. There is good reason to believe that have newspapers it out   and the Associated Press deserves a good hand for job   no legal action would have been attempted by anyone concerned. It wouldn' t blown over. It may do that anyhow. Delaying Action  Sarah says, according to quotes from reporters, if no words are sworn out the evidence will be submitted to a February grand jury. It is precisely the sort of thing the nation can not understand. The nation knows that a white man and shot in cold blood by a Negro there would' ve been no such delay. John Doe warrants for the been immediately issued in the entire machinery of the lower have been set in motion. The bloodhounds from the posse would have been out, night and day, until the guilty were apprehended or all possibility of capture exhausted. No Equal Protection  in the name of God, then, why can not the law operate equally to protect all citizens.  That' s the question nation and that' s the question the nation has a right to ask. Fedder for Russia  it is such a travesty of justice in the operation of law that the Russians use it in the Russians's newspapers to say to the Russians's people that in Americana man may be murdered because of man's race. It is such an obvious reluctance to apply the same vigor to bring killer to jail as would have been applied with a dead man a white a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation. That it will subject Sheriff and other law enforcement officers to some penalty of federal law is probable. No Social Quality Issue  This has no element of social quality or mixing of the races. Is simply a case of murder and a self-styled  ˜wool-hat ' man said, in offering a reward, the white a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation wrote the laws and a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation are the more, therefore, for a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation to obey, and a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation, too, is subject to the penalties. Why South Is Tainted  at any rate, here in the nutshell of the murder near Lyons is the perfect illustration of why the South too often it presented to the nation is a region which flaps its own laws and is not interested in applying the penalty of law particulars of the dead a white man, the next Congress will surely pass some sort of anti-Lynch legislation be a Negro. People have the right to ask why the whole power of the law enforcement officers of the county was not thrown into the case; why the dogs were not out; why a posse is not organized. This is America, and he should build of law. The law enforcement policy in this case has hurt the South badly. There is no escaping the fact. There is no excuse that could be made for it. The Klan' s Role  there was another aspect of the case which was shameful. The original investigating officers for the state apparently were first interested in clearing the Ku Klux the Ku Klux Klan. This does not appear to be a Klan killing, although it is exactly in the clan pattern. But it will be very interesting to learn, if the killers are ever brought to justice, whether the killers are members of the Ku Klux Klan. One might safely wager great odds the killers's members. There is a relatively large the Ku Klux Klan element in the County of which Lyons is the county seat. And already the city and county are learning that the Klan in its philosophy are a cancer which corrupts all it touches   We simply can not say to the nation that will work out for complex problem honestly justify if left alone and that allow such a thing as this murder to be handled as it has been   and it is being   handled   What has happened not only is wicked and wrong, it just doesn' t make sense. Insert Georgia in the South and is the sort of illogical action that can not in any sense be excused. Mr. $ stated Carter is president of the NAACP in Montgomery County. If the whole Association are to secure strong branch strong branch presidents to carry forward out program, strong branch presidents must know that the whole the whole Association backs strong branch presidents up as strong branch presidents fight in the  ˜front line' trenches in places like Georgia,  stated $ stated Carter in a letter addressed to all NAACP branch presidents. He told of He's branch' s intensive two-year drive in rural Georgia County to get colored citizens to exercise their constitutional right to exercise colored citizens to exercise their constitutional right's constitutional right to vote, and of He's personal activity in driving many of these voters to the poll son the day of the election. Fled to Atlanta  But there are white men in Georgia who do not know the meaning of the Constitution of the United Sates of the United Sates,  stated Carter wrote. It was a group of these men who attacked the Constitution of the United Sates on the Constitution of the United Sates's way home from the polls on Sept. 8, beating the Constitution of the United Sates with iron bars until the Constitution of the United Sates was bloody, breaking the Constitution of the United Sates's wrist, and ordering the Constitution of the United Sates at the point of a gun to go home and not to be caught hauling any more people to the polls. The 41-year-old $ stated Carter fled to Atlanta to seek refuge after the assault, but his wife and ten children and ten children had to remain in Montgomery County despite fear for his wife and ten children's safety, because there is no place for them to go. Identifies Assailants $ stated Carter told NAACP attorneys in Atlanta that one of $ stated Carter's assailants Johnnie Johnson, was one of the two brothers recently acquitted in the slaying of Isaac Nixon, 28-year-old Montgomery County man who had voted in the same primary election despite warnings from whites. Another of the men who attacked Carter who attacked $ stated Carter was Thomas Wilkes, a brother-in-law to Johnsons.

The other day a negro the Rev. John Harvard, John Harvard, was burned to death at the stake near Cochran, Ga. because he had shot and mortally wounded a white the white man's in a quarrel, not of he's seeking and in which he stood an equal chance of being shot. he's crime was without any of those revolting features which sometimes are offered in justification of the summary meting out of justice to the negroes of the south. The crime was without premeditation. A team of mules the negro's was driving was frightened by the white the white man's automobile. Pistols were drawn by both participants, but the negro's gun work was earlier and accurate. The negro's was captured in an hour or two -- in fact, the negro's was not stated that the negro's attempted to escape. the negro's was given time to pray, and then was burned, to the greater disgrace of Georgia. The quarrel between the mule driver and the automobilist was not unlike hundreds that used to take place in the northern states, notably in New York and New England, between automobilists and other citizens, before the speed laws were put into operation and before the right of the automobilists to live was clearly defined in a special interpretation of the law against homicide. Previous to that time the New England the New England farmer believed the automobilist to be a nuisance always subject to abatement. The puncturing of a tire with a bullet was frequently considered by the New England farmer to be full satisfaction, but now and then a shot was taken at the motorist himself. The automobilist was largely to blame for the bucolic hostility that was excited against himself. himself's carelessness and sometimes himself's cussedness in the matter of scaring farm-reared horses by unnecessary'  honk-honking almost justified the homicidal wrath of the farmers. Who knows but the Rev. John Harvard was provoked out of a clerical attitude by a careless automobile driver? Brooks Lane, a young farmer was hanged to a tree near the jail, and Brooks Lane, a young farmer's body was riddled with bullets.
