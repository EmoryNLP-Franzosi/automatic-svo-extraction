The question of protection for the white the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts in the sparsely settled farming districts is the topic of the day. The Atlanta Constitution devotes a page to a collection of opinions on how proper protection can be afforded to the women of the country. Of the matter Governor Chandler has this to say:  The question for protection for women and homes in the country is one of deep interest and which weights upon my's heart. my think the wisest plan for protection will be fore the legislature to take up the matter and provide a sufficient state militia and funds to be expended for a patrol in the country districts. Oates Would Arm the Women Former Governor William J. Oates expressed one good Winchester as follows:  My first suggestion is that all homes should be made miniature arsenals, at least to the extent of one good one good Winchester and one good pistol; that the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts be allowed to carry weapons upon the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts's persons, concealed if so desired, and that the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts be taught the use and handling of firearms so the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts may become the white women in the sparsely settled farming districts's own protectors in the absence of the husband of master of the house.
